      BTS is a boy group from South Korea with 7 handsome men consisting of Jin, RM, Suga, Jhope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. BTS debuted on June 13, 2013 about 8 years ago. BTS started his career from the agency BIGHIT ENTERTAIMENT and has now changed its name to HYBE LABELS, the founder of this company on behalf of BANG SI-YUK (PD NIM).
      BTS has a fan name nickname, ARMY. BTS itself stands for Bangtan Seonyeondan(방탄소년단).before success now BTS has had a lot of bitter life journeys. Because they debuted from an agency in the past, they were despised and never even appreciated as an artist. 
      They even performed only when the event was over and had been removed from the list of performances at a prestigious event in Korea besides that they also practiced in front of the toilet because they were not provided with a waiting room and practice room.
      But BTS never got tired of it all, until in 2016 they got the award for the first time.BTS is also often accused of plagiarism by hatters, they never bother with what the hatters say.
      they reward the hatters with achievements and they also prove that they are worthy of respect and deserve to be on the international stage. 2016 was the beginning of the year where they started their success. until they get many awards for their hard work.
      Not only that. Since Dynamite was released, this South Korean boy group has managed to attract the attention of many parties. Besides Dynamite, BTS still has many other songs that are included in Billboard's HOT 100, you know. This proves that even though they use the local language, their music can be accepted by many people.
      in 2021 they won an award for the umpteenth time, which was 6 consecutive weeks on 100 billboard music, breaking a record. not only that they were also nominated at the grammy awards.
